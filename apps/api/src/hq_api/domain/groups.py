"""Working groups as data (contract §29.11 ⟨1.11⟩, docs/MANAGEMENT_REVIEW_2026-11.md §4).

A group is a file (apps/api/seed/groups/<key>.yaml): its seats, its daily
and weekly routines, its KPIs, the connections it needs and who is eligible.
A new group is a new file, no new code. `seed` loads every file (at startup
and on every tick): a changed file makes a new version (growth.group_versions
keeps each); the owner's pauses (a routine, a membership) survive it.

Members: every active company that is eligible (`has_channel`: at least one
publishing channel among its §29.12 connections) joins by itself, a new
company too; the owner may pause a membership. Each seat resolves to the
company's active employee with the seat's charter; an empty seat is filled
by automatic hiring (§29.10, `hiring.auto_fill`, prompt 21 part 1) and shows
in the readiness page (§29.9) until it is.

The tick (worker, every 10 minutes, rule-based, no model; nothing while the
holding is locked, nothing for a locked company): when a routine's
occurrence is due for a member, ONE small work item for the seat's employee
(its brief from the routine, `max_tokens` as its budget), recorded in
growth.routine_runs under a unique (group, company, routine, occurrence):
never twice for one period. The model runs only in that employee's run.
